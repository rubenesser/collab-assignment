          <h2 class="title">The Soukh</h2>

          <p>Rissani is a tiny town in the countryside, surrounded by tiny little villages. It's the biggest settlement for a while, and it houses a massive soukh that contains in it the wares of all the tradesmen and farmers for kilometres around.</p>

          <p>The raw authenticity of the soukh is a rare sight, especially after visiting Marrakech, which is more for tourists. Cow's heads are sold at the butcher stall next to a wonderfully full room of dates (in the right season), next to cabinet makers selling furniture.</p>

          <p>The soukh is central to the town, but already tour busses from nearby hotels pass through there, signaling that the undiscovered realism of the place may soon change.</p>

          <h2 class="title">The palace</h2>

          <p>But the soukh is not the only thing to do â€“ the previous king, Hassan II, kept a palace here. While the palace has been shut down, the structure remains and an old man keeps the memory alive. As we walked in the now empty halls with him he regailed us of stories of the golden years, when the palace was full of life and he, a local family man, worked tirelessly for his king.</p>
