      <h2>Gastromonics</h2>

        <p>By all means this is conviviality and joy. And slowness of course. Enjoying a meal with friends or family is the main ingredient of any Italian dish. Italian Sunday lunches are the best example, a unique experience you should try at least once. Italian sunday lunch They say only 5% of Italians eat out on Sundays, while 95% are at home eating as much as humanly possible. Sunday lunch is usually spent at some relatives’ home, in my case my grandparents’.

          In any household there is always a grandma or aunt who thinks you are malnourished, too skinny and need to be filled as a Christmas turkey. You will not be able to leave your grandma’s table if you do not eat every single crumble she thinks you need.

          This will also be your fate if you are invited for lunch at an Italian gathering... be prepared! </p>

          <p> Lunch usually starts between 12am and 1pm depending on the region, and can last literally all day, sometimes even until dinner time. It’s the main occasion to bring the extended family together, and the only time ALL courses are included.

          Starting from antipasto, closing with dessert, followed by caffe’ and ammazza-caffe’ (lit. coffee killer, a small amount of liquor or spirit). Even the poorest class used to save their meat for this special weekly gathering.

          Classic antipasti are usually made of charcuterie, cheese, pickles and whatever the matriarch comes up with. </p>
